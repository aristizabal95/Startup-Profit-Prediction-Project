## Predict the success of a startup 

A venture capitalist requires actionable insights into the Business model and comparing it with the trends of 50 top startups.

The Venture capitalist would like to identify the startup’s success by analyzing the trends and features of 50 top startups based on the total amount of money spent on research and development, administration, marketing according to the region where the business operates.

- Create a  statistical model to predict the potential demand and success of the start-up. 
- Also, there is a need to develop a generalized model to identify the right algorithm.
- The prediction model must identify the efficient model by comparing one business model’s scores to another.

In this project, the whole Data Science Pipeline is implemented, from Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis to model reation and hyperparameter tuning. Models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressors and Random Forest Regressors are used and compared in an algorithmic way.
The final result is a tree that explains 98% of the variability of the data on an unseen partition (test set).
